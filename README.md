## Description 
This back-end node.js application allows the user to update their online retail store catalog. You can add, update, and delete new products and link them to specific categories and tag names. 
## Installation
1. Open your machine's terminal and navigate to the directory you want to save the application in.
2. Clone <a href="https://github.com/angeeg/ecom-backend.git">this</a> repo in the command line.
3. Open the cloned repo in your code editor. 
4. Open the terminal in your code editor and run 'npm i' to make sure all node packages are up to date and initialized. 
5. Start the server by running 'npm start'.
## Usage 
There is no front-end code for this application, so it is only functional on the back-end. Use this app to update the database of e-commerce products, categories, and tags directly through the server.
